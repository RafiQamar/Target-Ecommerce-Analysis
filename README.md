# Target E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing the Target e-commerce dataset obtained from Kaggle. The project utilizes Python, SQL, and Jupyter Notebook to load, query, and visualize data, providing insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and more.

## Features
- **Dataset Loading**: Multiple CSV files loaded into a MySQL database using `SQLAlchemy`, `pymysql`, `os`, and `pandas`.
- **Data Analysis**: Queries range from basic to advanced to extract actionable insights from the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Insights visualized using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

## Dataset
The dataset contains multiple CSV files, including:
- `customers.csv`
- `orders.csv`
- `sellers.csv`
- `products.csv`
- `geolocation.csv`
- `payments.csv`
- `order_items.csv`

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RafiQamar/target-ecommerce-analysis.git
   cd target-ecommerce-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up MySQL database:
   - Create a database named `commerce`.
   - Use the script provided in the `csv_to_sql.py` file to load CSV files into the database.

## Queries Solved
### Basic Queries
1. **List all unique cities where customers are located.**
2. **Count the number of orders placed in 2017.**
3. **Find the total sales per category.**
4. **Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.**
5. **Count the number of customers from each state.**

### Intermediate Queries
1. **Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.**
2. **Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.**
3. **Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.**
4. **Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.**
5. **Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller and rank them by revenue.**

### Advanced Queries
1. **Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.**
2. **Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.**
3. **Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.**
4. **Calculate the retention rate of customers (percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase).**
5. **Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.**

## Findings
### Key Insights:
1. **Unique Cities**: Customers are spread across numerous unique cities, providing opportunities for region-specific marketing.
2. **Order Trends**: Orders peak during certain months, highlighting potential seasonality.
3. **Revenue Contribution**: Certain product categories contribute significantly more revenue, indicating high-performing segments.
4. **Installment Payments**: A notable percentage of orders are paid in installments, suggesting a preference for flexible payment options.
5. **Top Customers and Sellers**: Identifying high-value customers and top-performing sellers can guide retention and partnership strategies.

## Visualization
Key insights are visualized using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`, including:
- Monthly order trends.
- Revenue contribution by product categories.
- Seller revenue rankings.

## Usage
1. Open the Python file (`csv_to_sql.py`).
   - Load data into MySQL.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Target_Ecommerce_Analysis_SQL_Python.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Execute SQL queries to answer the provided questions.
